# BM-Ontology
Ontology for mechanical pump failure diagnostics

The BM_Ontology is a domain ontology for root cause analysis of rod sucker pump systems in the Onshore Oil production.  The actual ontology is proprietary so we cannot display the entire ontology with the instances and business rules. On the other hand, we included part of the ontology that is public domain and that is also part of the actual domain ontology.

Hopefully, it serves as a starting point for others to work.
The sample ontology is available in OWL.  We used WebProtege to build it and exported in owl.
